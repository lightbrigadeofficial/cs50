I have 4 sprites: an F1 car, a "go!" which pops up when lights go off, Traffic light and A splash screen.
Script for Splash Screen:
	when green flag clicked
	SplashScreen_Trigger
	
	define {SplashScreen_Trigger}
	show
	go to [Front v] layer
	set [RaceState v] to (Ready)
	set [ReactionTime v] to (0)
	
	when [s v] key pressed
	broadcast (Start! v)
	hide
Script for Traffic Light:
	when I recieve [Start! v]
	switch costume to (lights_on v)
	set [RaceState v] to (Ready)
	wait (1) seconds
	broadcast (StartSequence v)
	
	when I recieve [StartSequence v]
	StartSequence
	
	define {StartSequence}
	set [RaceState v] to (Waiting)
	wait (pick random (2) to (5)) seconds
	switch costume to (lights_off v)
	set [RaceState v] to (Green)
	broadcast (Go!)
Script for Go pop up:
	when I recieve [Go! v]
	show
	go to [front v] layer
	start sound (store-scanner-beep-90395 v)
	wait (1) seconds
	hide
Script for F1 car:
	when I recieve [Start! v]
	go to x: (0) y: (-100)
	set [ReactionTime v] to (0)
	repeat (5)
		say (Wait for lights to go OFF, then press SPACE!) for (0.4) seconds
		wait (0.1) seconds
	
	when I recive [Go! v]
	reset timer
	
	when [space v]` key pressed
	if <(RaceState) = (Green)> then
		set [ReactionTime v] tp (timer)
		say (join (Reaction Time: ) (join (ReactionTime) (Secs) for (2) seconds))
		if <<(BestTime) = (0)> or <(ReactionTime) < (BestTime)>> then
			set [BestTime v] to (ReactionTime)
			say (NEW BEST!) for (1) seconds
	else
		if <(RaceState) = (Waiting)> then
			say (FALSE START!) for (2) seconds
